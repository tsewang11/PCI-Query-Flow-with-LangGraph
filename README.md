# 🧠 PCI Query Flow with LangGraph

An AI-powered chatbot built with **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Mistral (via Ollama)** that simulates Predictive Customer Intelligence (PCI). The system captures user queries, segments the customer, and generates personalized suggestions using a local LLM.

---

## ✨ Features

- 💬 Conversational chatbot with Streamlit interface
- 🧠 Memory-aware using LangChain memory
- 🧩 Modular LangGraph flow with 3 nodes:
  - `capture_query`: Stores query + retrieves chat history
  - `segment`: Classifies user (e.g., Price-Sensitive, Returning)
  - `suggest`: Generates personalized message using Mistral
- 🔁 Persistent memory per session (supports multi-turn interaction)
- 🧪 Easily testable via local UI or REST endpoints (optional)

## 🧪 Example Test Prompts

| User Query                 | Segment Inferred   | Sample AI Suggestion                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Message** → captured via Streamlit UI.
2. **LangGraph Flow** triggers:
   - Memory update
   - Context retrieval
   - Customer segmentation
   - AI-generated suggestion using Mistral
3. **Response** is shown in chat + stored in memory for context.
